# MySQL-Exploit 

(Using METASPLOIT)

## MySQL

MySQL, as an RDBMS, is made up of the server and utility programs that help in the administration of mySQL databases.

The server handles all database instructions like creating editing and accessing data. It takes, and manages these requests and communicates using the MySQL protocol. This whole process can be broken down into these stages:

1. MySQL creates a database for storing and manipulating data, defining the relationship of each table.
2. Clients make requests by making specific statements in SQL.
3. The server will respond to the client with whatever information has been requested 

## Enumerating SQL

IP : `10.10.231.103`

Port : {`mysql`:`3306`,`ssh` : `22`}

Username(given) : `root`        --> (for mysql port)

Password(given) : `password`    --> (for mysql port)

**nmap scan** : [here](/nmap/nmap.txt)

With a set of credentials we can log in using : `mysql -h [IP] -u [username] -p`

## Exploiting MySQL

Schema: *In MySQL, physically, a schema is synonymous with a database. You can substitute the keyword "SCHEMA" instead of DATABASE in MySQL SQL syntax, for example using CREATE SCHEMA instead of CREATE DATABASE. It's important to understand this relationship because some other database products draw a distinction. For example, in the Oracle Database product, a schema represents only a part of a database: the tables and other objects owned by a single user.*

Used metasploit modules 
1. `mysql_sql` module for enumerations
2. `mysql_schemadump` to print tables
3. `mysql_hashdump` to find hash text

After finding the hash run JohnTheRipper on [`carl.txt`](/metasploit/carl.txt) : `doggie`
